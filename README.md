# Multi-Calculator Program (Python)

This is a beginner **Python** program that performs multiple real-world calculations using user input and formatted output.

The program includes three main sections:
1. Calculates the **cost of gas per mile**
2. Calculates **annual and daily compounded interest**
3. Calculates the **diagonal size of a screen** using the Pythagorean Theorem

This project demonstrates basic Python skills such as:
- User input with `input()`
- Mathematical calculations
- Working with percentages and decimals
- Using the `math` library
- Formatted output with f-strings
